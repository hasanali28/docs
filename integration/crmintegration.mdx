### Overview

Integrate and monitor **HubSpot** or **Zoho CRM** within Weya AI to automate call tracking, sales synchronization, and customer relationship workflows.  
Both CRMs follow the same stepwise flow, where **you first integrate and monitor** the connection, and **mapping is configured later** by clicking **Configure**.

---

### 1. Access Integrations

1. Navigate to the **Integrations** tab from the sidebar.  
2. Under **Available Integrations**, choose **HubSpot** or **Zoho CRM**.  
3. Click **Connect** to begin the setup.

---

### 2. Authenticate CRM Connection

When you click **Connect**, youâ€™re redirected to the CRM authentication page.

- **HubSpot:** Log into your HubSpot account and approve access for Weya AI.  
- **Zoho:** Sign in to Zoho CRM and authorize Weya AI API permissions.  

Once authentication succeeds, the connection is securely established.

### 3. Configure Credentials

Next, configure your CRM details inside Weya AI:

- **Choose CRM:** HubSpot or Zoho  
- **Region:** Choose (e.g., Asia or Europe)  
- **Client ID** & **Client Secret:** Obtained from your CRM developer console  
- **Redirect URL:** Auto-filled by Weya AI  
- **Access Token / Refresh Token:** Paste generated tokens  
- **Token Type:** Bearer  
- **Expires In** (3600 seconds) and **Expires At** (expiry date)

Once all details are filled, click **Save** to finalize the integration.

---

### 4. Monitor CRM Integration (Before Mapping)

![Active Integration](/images/crm-active.png)

After saving credentials, go to **My Integrations** â€” your CRM will appear as **Active** if connected successfully.

From here, you can :

- Monitor integration health and token validity  
- View active CRM connections  
- Confirm real-time status (e.g., Active / Processing)

This monitoring step ensures your integration is live before moving to mapping.

---

### 5. Click Configure to Map Data

Once your CRM shows **Active**, click **Configure** to set up mapping for synced data.

#### Configuration Setup
- **Module Name:** Select what to sync â€” e.g., Contacts or Leads.  
- **Unique Key:** Choose fields identifying unique records (Email, First Name).  
- **Required Fields:** Define mandatory data points (Email, DOB).

#### Mapping Call Data
- Assign specific **Agents** to CRM modules.  
- Choose which call details to sync:
  - Call Duration  
  - Call Cost  
  - Call Transcription  
  - Call Recording

#### Sync Frequency
- Select how often data syncs between CRM and Weya AI:
  - **Realtime Sync**
  - **Every 3 hours**
  - **Once a day**

When mapping is complete, click **Save** to activate it.

---

### ðŸ’¡ Tips

- This flow is identical for both **HubSpot** and **Zoho CRM**.  
- Always verify the CRM authorization before configuring mapping.  
- Refresh expired tokens regularly to ensure continuous sync.  
- You may reconfigure mapping anytime via the **Configure** button in **My Integrations**.

---

Once setup and mapping are done, Weya AI automatically synchronizes CRM data, logging call metrics, agent performance, and real-time updates across both CRMs.
