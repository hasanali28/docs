title: "Create Call Batch"
description: "Create a named outbound batch and assign the phone numbers that will originate the campaign."
openapi: "POST /api/call/createBatch"
---

## Overview
Create a batch whenever you want to stage a new outbound campaign. The batch groups a friendly `batchName` with one or more provisioned calling numbers so you can add contacts and start dialing later. The response returns the `batchId`, which is required by every follow-up batch operation.

## Prerequisites
- You generated an API key with Calling Management scope.
- At least one outbound phone number is active on the workspace.
- The calling numbers you pass belong to the same workspace as the API key.

## Request
<ParamField header="x-api-key" type="string" required>
Workspace API key. Find it under **Settings → API access**.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="batchName" type="string" required>
Human readable campaign name shown in the Nexus dashboard.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="callingNumbers" type="array[string]" required>
Array of phone IDs that the dialer can rotate through while placing calls from this batch.
</ParamField>

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl --location '{{baseUrl}}/api/call/createBatch' \
  --header 'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "batchName": "API Campaign May 2025",
    "callingNumbers": ["64e5f12345abcdef87654321"]
  }'
```
</RequestExample>

## Response
<ResponseExample>
```json 201 Created
{
  "success": true,
  "batchId": "64e5f12345abcdef98765432",
  "message": "Batch created successfully"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean" required>
Indicates whether the batch record was stored.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="batchId" type="string" required>
Identifier to use when adding calls, starting the dialer, or updating batch metadata.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
Human readable confirmation message.
</ResponseField>

## Error Handling
- **400 Bad Request** – Missing `batchName`, missing or empty `callingNumbers`, or malformed JSON.
- **403 Forbidden** – The `x-api-key` is missing, revoked, or belongs to a different workspace.
- **500 Internal Server Error** – Nexus could not persist the batch; retry or contact support with the request ID.

<Check>
Use `GET /api/call/batches/{userId}` right after creation to verify that the new batch appears with the expected metadata.
