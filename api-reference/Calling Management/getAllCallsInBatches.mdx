title: "Export Batch Calls"
description: "Download every call from a batch in a single response for analytics or CSV exports."
openapi: "GET /api/call/batch/{batchId}/all"
---

## Overview
When you need the full call history for a batch—including transcripts, analysis metrics, and recording links—use this export endpoint. Unlike the paginated detail view it streams all calls at once, making it convenient for reporting pipelines.

## Prerequisites
- Bearer token that can access the batch.
- The `batchId` whose calls you want to export.

## Request
<ParamField path="batchId" type="string" required>
Batch identifier to export.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Authorization" type="string" required>
Bearer token for an authorised workspace admin.
</ParamField>

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl --location '{{baseUrl}}/api/call/batch/680b465749a5db1758677ab0/all' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer {{authToken}}'
```
</RequestExample>

## Error Handling
- **400 Bad Request** – `batchId` missing or malformed.
- **404 Not Found** – Batch does not exist or the user lacks access.
- **500 Internal Server Error** – Export failed; retry and contact support if it recurs.

<Info>
Responses can become large for high-volume campaigns. Stream the response or page through `GET /api/call/batch-details/{batchId}` if your client has tight memory limits.
