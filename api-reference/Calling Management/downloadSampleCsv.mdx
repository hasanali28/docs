## Overview
Download the sample CSV to understand the column order and header naming conventions required by `POST /api/call/upload`. Start every campaign by cloning this template so validation passes on the first try.

## Request
No authentication is required; the sample is publicly accessible.

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl --location '{{baseUrl}}/api/call/export/sample' --output nexus-batch-template.csv
```
</RequestExample>

## Response
<ResponseExample>
```text 200 OK
phoneNumber,name,loan_amount,loan_tenure
+15559876543,John Doe,10000,12 days
```
</ResponseExample>

<Info>
Keep the header row intact. You can add extra columns—the upload service will forward them to the agent as metadata—but required fields must stay in place.
