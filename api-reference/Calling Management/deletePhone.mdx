## Overview
Delete phone numbers that you no longer pay for or that have been reassigned. The number is removed from the workspace and no longer appears in batch or agent pickers.

## Prerequisites
- Bearer token for an admin user.
- The `phoneId` of the record you want to remove.
- Confirm that no active batches rely on the number.

## Request
<ParamField path="phoneId" type="string" required>
Identifier of the phone record to delete.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Authorization" type="string" required>
Bearer token for the workspace admin.
</ParamField>

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl --location --request DELETE '{{baseUrl}}/api/call/delete-phone/64e5f12345abcdef87654321' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer {{authToken}}'
```
</RequestExample>

## Response
<ResponseExample>
```json 200 OK
{
  "success": true,
  "deletedId": "64e5f12345abcdef87654321"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

<ResponseField name="deletedId" type="string" required>
Confirms which phone record was removed.
</ResponseField>

## Error Handling
- **400 Bad Request** – `phoneId` missing or invalid.
- **404 Not Found** – Phone already deleted or does not belong to the workspace.
- **500 Internal Server Error** – Deletion failed; retry or contact support with the `phoneId`.

<Warning>
Deleting a number clears it from existing batches. Update those batches first to avoid dialer failures.
</Warning>
