title: "Stop Batch Dialing"
description: "Stop new outbound calls from starting while allowing in-flight calls to finish gracefully."
openapi: "POST /api/call/stop-calling"
---

## Overview
Call this endpoint when you want to pause or end a campaign early. The batch status switches to *stopped*, preventing the dialer from launching additional calls. Existing conversations continue until they complete or hit agent-configured thresholds.

## Prerequisites
- You know the `batchId` you want to stop.
- The authenticated user owns or administrates the batch.

## Request
<ParamField header="Authorization" type="string" required>
Bearer token for an authorised workspace admin.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="batchId" type="string" required>
Batch identifier to halt.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="userId" type="string" required>
Workspace user responsible for the batch. Used for auditing and scoping.
</ParamField>

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl --location '{{baseUrl}}/api/call/stop-calling' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer {{authToken}}' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "batchId": "64e5f12345abcdef98765432",
    "userId": "64e5f12345abcdef12345678"
  }'
```
</RequestExample>

## Response
<ResponseExample>
```json 200 OK
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Batch marked as stopped"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean" required>
Confirms that no new calls will be created for the batch.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
Provides additional context such as whether calls were still in progress.
</ResponseField>

## Error Handling
- **400 Bad Request** – Request body missing `batchId` or `userId`, or payload failed validation.
- **401 Unauthorized** – Bearer token missing or invalid.
- **404 Not Found** – Batch does not exist or is already archived.
- **500 Internal Server Error** – Pausing failed due to a service issue; retry then escalate to support.

<Check>
Use `GET /api/call/batches/{userId}` afterwards and confirm the batch status is `stopped`.
