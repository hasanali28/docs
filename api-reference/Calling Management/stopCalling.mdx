title: "Stop Batch Dialing"
description: "Stop new outbound calls from starting while allowing in-flight calls to finish gracefully."
openapi: "POST /api/call/stop-calling"
---

## Overview
Call this endpoint when you want to pause or end a campaign early. The batch status switches to *stopped*, preventing the dialer from launching additional calls. Existing conversations continue until they complete or hit agent-configured thresholds.

## Prerequisites
- You know the `batchId` you want to stop.
- The authenticated user owns or administrates the batch.

## Request
<ParamField header="Authorization" type="string" required>
Bearer token for an authorised workspace admin.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="batchId" type="string" required>
Batch identifier to halt.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="userId" type="string" required>
Workspace user responsible for the batch. Used for auditing and scoping.
</ParamField>

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl --location '{{baseUrl}}/api/call/stop-calling' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer {{authToken}}' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "batchId": "64e5f12345abcdef98765432",
    "userId": "64e5f12345abcdef12345678"
  }'
```
</RequestExample>

</ResponseField>

## Error Handling

- **400 Bad Request** – Missing required parameters (`batchId` or `userId`).
- **401 Unauthorized** – Bearer token missing or expired.
- **404 Not Found** – Batch not found or user not found.
- **500 Internal Server Error** – Failed to stop calling service or call queue; retry or contact support.

<Note>
**Stopping Behavior:**

- Prevents new calls from being initiated for the batch
- In-flight calls are allowed to complete naturally
- The call queue is stopped to prevent new call processing
- Batch status is updated to reflect the stopped state
</Note>

<Check>
After stopping, verify the batch status using `GET /api/call/batches/{userId}` to confirm it shows as stopped.
