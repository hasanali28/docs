title: "Get Agent Testing Result"
description: "Retrieve transcripts and metrics generated by the agent testing sandbox."
---

## Overview
After triggering a test conversation with `POST /api/agents/test-agent-chat` or by creating a test call, you can retrieve the evaluation artefacts—transcripts, call scores, and state transitions—through the testing results endpoint.

<Warning>
Implementation details vary by environment. Align with your backend team on the final URL (for example `GET /api/agents/testing-results/{testId}`) and authentication requirements before consuming this API in production tools.
</Warning>

## Recommended Usage Flow
<Steps>
<Step title="Start a test">
Use `POST /api/agents/test-agent-chat` or `POST /api/agents/create/call` with test data to trigger the sandbox conversation.
</Step>
<Step title="Poll for the result">
Call the testing-results endpoint with the `testId` returned in the start response. Poll until `status` is `completed`.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect metrics">
Review the transcript, intent transitions, sentiment metrics, and any tool invocations to validate the conversation.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Suggested Response Contract
<ResponseExample>
```json 200 OK
{
  "success": true,
  "testId": "test_01J1YMQ34V6Q2WSBRZ6X6A2A2T",
  "status": "completed",
  "transcript": [
    { "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "Hello Alex, this is Nova from Nexus." },
    { "speaker": "USER", "text": "Hi!" }
  ],
  "analysis": {
    "statesVisited": ["START", "QUALIFY", "CLOSING"],
    "score": 0.92,
    "notes": "Agent correctly validated eligibility"
  }
}
```
</ResponseExample>

<ResponseField name="transcript" type="array">
Ordered list of dialog turns captured during the test.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="analysis" type="object">
Collection of metrics and derived insights returned by the sandbox.
</ResponseField>

## Error Handling Guidance
- **404 Not Found** – The `testId` is unknown or the test expired.
- **409 Conflict** – Test still running; wait a few seconds before polling again.
- **500 Internal Server Error** – Sandbox failed; rerun the test or contact support with the `testId`.

<Tip>
Store the `testId` together with commit or release metadata so you can trace which prompts were validated during QA.
