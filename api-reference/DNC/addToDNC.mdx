## Error Handling

- **400 Bad Request** – Missing required fields (`phoneNumber`, `batchId`, or `requestUUID`), or phone number already exists in DNC for this organization.
- **404 Not Found** – Batch not found, user not found for the batch, or call record not found for the given `batchId` and `requestUUID`.
- **500 Internal Server Error** – Server error while processing the request.

<Note>
When a phone number is added to the DNC list, the system automatically:
- Links the DNC entry to your organization
- Associates it with the batch and call record
- Stores call recording and transcription data (if available)
- Sends an email notification to your organization's admin
