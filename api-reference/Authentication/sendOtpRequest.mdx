## Overview
Nexus supports passwordless login flows by sending a one-time password (OTP) to the user’s verified email or phone number. The backend exposes a lightweight endpoint that accepts an email or phone contact and returns a success acknowledgement once the OTP is dispatched.

<Warning>
The final URL and payload shape may differ depending on your deployment. Confirm the path with your backend team (typically `POST /api/auth/send-otp` or `POST /api/auth/request-otp`) before going live.
</Warning>

## Recommended Request Contract
<ParamField body="identifier" type="string" required>
Email address or E.164 phone number where the OTP should be sent.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="channel" type="string" allowedValues="email,sms" default="email">
Delivery channel. Restrict to the contact methods you verify during signup.
</ParamField>

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl --location '{{baseUrl}}/api/auth/send-otp' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "identifier": "alex@example.com",
    "channel": "email"
  }'
```
</RequestExample>

## Expected Response
<ResponseExample>
```json 200 OK
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "OTP sent if the account exists"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean" required>
Returns `true` when the request was accepted.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
Human readable confirmation. Use the same copy across web and mobile clients to avoid confusion.
</ResponseField>

## Error Handling Guidance
- **400 Bad Request** – Unsupported channel or invalid identifier format.
- **429 Too Many Requests** – The user has requested too many OTPs. Enforce a cooldown on the client (e.g., 30 seconds).
- **500 Internal Server Error** – Delivery provider failed. Retry after a short delay and show a generic error to the user.

<Tip>
Surface a consistent “Didn’t receive the code?” flow that allows users to resend the OTP after the cooldown and to fall back to an alternate channel if available.
