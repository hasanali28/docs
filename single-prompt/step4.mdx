## How to Set Up a Post Call Metric
Step-by-step guide:

### **Metric Name**  
Enter a unique, descriptive metric name (e.g., "Customer Satisfaction", "Order Status", "Follow-up Required").  
This helps you quickly identify what data you're tracking for each call.

### **Data Type**  
Choose from several data types to fit your tracking needs:  

- **Text** â€“ Free-form summaries or notes from the call.  
- **Single Extract** â€“ Extract one specific item of information (like the customer's answer or score).  
- **Boolean (Yes/No)** â€“ Track simple outcomes: was the order placed? Did the issue get resolved?  
- **Timestamp** â€“ Store the exact time something happened on the call.  
- **Date** â€“ Save calendar-based dates, such as appointment dates.  
- **Numeric** â€“ Store quantities, ratings, codes (for example, feedback scores).  
- **Multi Extract** â€“ Collect multiple pieces of data from the same call for richer reporting.

### **Description**  
Document what each metric tracks and how itâ€™s calculated.  
Clearly explain how the agent should use or interpret this field.

### Example: Custom Post Call Metric
```
Suppose you want to track how satisfied customers are after a call.

- Metric Name: Customer Satisfaction Score  
- Data Type: Numeric  
- Description: "Extract a rating from 0 to 10 based on how satisfied the customer sounds during the call. If the customer directly provides a rating, use that value. Otherwise, estimate based on conversation sentiment."
```

### ðŸ’¡Tip
- Use meaningful metric names so everyone on your team understands whatâ€™s being tracked.  
- Pick the most suitable data type to make reporting and analysis easy.  
- Clearly describe each metric for consistent agent use and accurate data.
