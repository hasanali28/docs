### 1. Auto Detect Language
Enables automatic detection of the callerâ€™s language.  

Useful for multilingual audiences; the agent adapts without manual intervention.  
Keeps conversations natural and reduces errors caused by language mismatches.

### 2. Retry on Voicemail
Automatically retries calls when voicemail is detected.  

Helps ensure your call connects with a real person.  
Ideal for important, time-sensitive outreach.

### 3. Ambient Noise
Adds background sound to simulate realistic environments.

**Noise Type:**  
Selects the background (e.g., "office-with-telephone").  
Use quieter options for support calls; busier for informal calls.

**Noise Volume:**  
Adjusts loudness of ambient sound (0 to 1).  
Set low for minimal distraction; higher for immersive experiences.

### 4. Vocabulary
Lets you specify custom or frequently used words.  

Boosts speech recognition accuracy for names, technical terms, and company-specific lingo.  
Enter multiple words for broader coverage.

### 5. Max Timeout
Limits the length of each call.  

Adjust with slider (up to 30 minutes).  
Prevents long, unmonitored callsâ€”recommended for compliance and resource management.

### 6. Voice Speed
Controls how fast the agent speaks.  

1x is normal; increase for quicker responses, decrease for clarity.  
Great for accessibilityâ€”match caller needs and preferences.
